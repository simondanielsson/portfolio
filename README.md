## Portfolio of Simon Danielsson

[LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simon-danielsson-527b7b215/)

The portfolio consists of projects in courses at ETH ZÃ¼rich and the Faculty of Engineering at Lund University, as well as some private projects. Each course has been seperated into different directories.

In the following, a brief overview of some of the main material in the portfolio is presented. For more details I refer to the individual folders.  


### Summary 

#### Optimization 

- Implemented a multidimensional nonlinear optimizer using Quasi-Newton methods: specifically the DFP and BFGS methods. 'Exact' (Newton) line search was implemented. 
- Tests and thorough debugging facilities are implemented. Comprehensive report is available. 
- Implemented in Matlab.

#### Machine Learning projects, private

- Evaluation of different classification models trained using the hyperparameter tuning library <code>Ray Tune</code> and the AutoML-service <code>auto-sklearn</code>, respectively. 
- Implemented in Python.   

#### Numerical Analysis

- Numerical methods of solving PDE's and boundary value problems. Different schemes (RK, Crank-Nicholson etc.) are used on a vast set of PDE's; among them are viscous Burger's equation, convection-diffusion equation, advection equations etc.

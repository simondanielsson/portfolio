% When using the hanning window we can now observe the dip in spectral
% density around 0,25 Hz. Using the Fej√©r kernel (no data window) the dip
% is completely drowned by the leakage from the high power frequencies.
% This is due to the high amplitude sidelobes in the Fejer kernel. By using
% the hanning window, which has a lot quicker decreasing sidelobes, the
% leakage to nearby frequencies is a lot less (why the dip is not drowned
% by leakage). This is also called less biased. However, it also has a
% wider main lobe which means that leakage to adjacent frequencies is
% increased, which is seen as widened peaks everywhere.

% for x3, y1. 
% The coherence spectrum provides a measure of the linear dependence

% proportional to each other. Since it is white noise, the probability of
% two independently generated white noise sequences being proportional for
% all frequencies is essentially zero, so it has to be mixed up.

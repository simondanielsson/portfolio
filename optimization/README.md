Project in Optimization (FMAN61) at the Faculty of Engineering at Lund University.

The goal of the project was to build a multidimensional optimizer using Quasi-Newton's methods, specifically the DFP and BFGS methods using 'exact' line search. A full report on the task is found in <code>report.pdf</code>. 

The optimizer is found in <code>nonlinearmin.m</code>, using a line search method implemented in <code>newton.m</code>.
